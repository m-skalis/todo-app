## 🌟 What's New & Exciting

### ✨ **Enhanced Features**

### 🛠️ **New Technologies & Concepts**

#### 📦 **Ant Design (antd) - Your New Best Friend!**

Ant Design is a **popular React UI library** that provides pre-built, beautiful components. Think of it as having a designer on your team!

**What you get with Ant Design:**

- 🎨 **Pre-built components** (buttons, inputs, icons, etc.)
- 🔧 **Consistent design** across your entire app
- 📱 **Mobile-friendly** components out of the box
- ⚡ **Saves development time** - no need to style everything from scratch

**Icons in Ant Design:**

```jsx
import {
  CheckCircleOutlined, // ✅ Checkmark icon
  DeleteOutlined, // 🗑️ Delete icon
  EditOutlined, // ✏️ Edit icon
  StarFilled, // ⭐ Star icon
  SearchOutlined, // 🔍 Search icon
} from '@ant-design/icons';

// Use them like this:
<CheckCircleOutlined className="my-icon" />;
```

**Pro Tip:** Ant Design has **hundreds of icons**! Browse them at: [Ant Design Icons](https://ant.design/components/icon)

#### 🛣️ **React Router - Multiple Pages Made Easy!**

React Router lets you create **multi-page applications** in React. Instead of one giant component, you can organize your app into logical pages!

**How it works:**

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

<Router>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} /> // Home page
    <Route path="/todos" element={<TodosPage />} /> // Todos page
    <Route path="/about" element={<AboutPage />} /> // About page
  </Routes>
</Router>;
```

**Navigation between pages:**

```jsx
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

<Link to="/todos">Go to Todos</Link>; // Creates a clickable link
```
